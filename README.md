# ADT-1 Auditor Appointment Extractor

This project automates the extraction and summarization of auditor appointment details from a signed Form ADT-1 PDF, including its embedded attachments. It uses OCR and PDF parsing to generate structured data and human-readable summaries.

## Features

- Extracts key fields (company, auditor, dates, etc.) from Form ADT-1 PDF.
- Saves extracted data as JSON.
- Extracts and summarizes embedded attachments (PDFs, TXT).
- Generates a summary text file with company and attachment information.
- Handles scanned/image-based PDFs using OCR.

## Project Structure

```

    extractor.py
    Form ADT-1-29092023_signed.pdf
    output.json
    summary.txt
    attachments/
        Consent signed.pdf

```

- `extractor.py`: Main script for extraction and summarization.
- `Form ADT-1-29092023_signed.pdf`: Input PDF file.
- `output.json`: Extracted structured data.
- `summary.txt`: Human-readable summary of extracted data and attachments.
- `attachments/`: Extracted embedded files from the PDF.
- `debug_output/`: Intermediate images for OCR debugging.
- `temp/`: Temporary files (e.g., raw extracted text).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Tesseract OCR (must be installed and available in PATH)

Install Python dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your signed Form ADT-1 PDF in the `adt1_submission/` folder and name it `Form ADT-1-29092023_signed.pdf` (or update the script with your filename).
2. Run the extractor script:

```sh
cd adt1_submission
python extractor.py
```

3. After execution:
    - `output.json` will contain the extracted fields.
    - `summary.txt` will contain a summary of the company and attachments.
    - Attachments will be extracted to the `attachments/` folder.

## Customization

- To process a different PDF, change the `pdf_path` variable in [`extractor.py`](adt1_submission/extractor.py).
- The extraction logic (regex patterns, summary formatting) can be adjusted in [`extractor.py`](adt1_submission/extractor.py).

## Dependencies

See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):

- fastapi
- uvicorn
- pymupdf
- requests
- python-dotenv
- pydantic
- opencv-python
- numpy
- pdf2image
- pytesseract

## Notes

- For best OCR results, ensure Tesseract is properly installed.
- The script is designed for the specific structure of Form ADT-1 and may require adjustments for other forms or layouts.
